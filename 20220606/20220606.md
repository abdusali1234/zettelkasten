## Excel Tips

Use Excel shortcuts, they're pretty nifty. All shortcuts start with the Alt key. Some shortcuts learnt today:

- Change column width to see all text: `Alt+H+O+I`
- Autofill Series: `Alt+H+F+I+S`

If unsure what key chords to use, just press `Tab` and the key options show up on screen.
